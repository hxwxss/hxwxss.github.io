title: "SimpleFusion: A Simple Fusion Framework for Infrared and Visible Images"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink:
excerpt: 'Our framework follows the decompose-and-fusion paradigm, where the visible and the infrared images are decomposed into reflectance and illumination components via Retinex theory and followed by the fusion of these corresponding elements. The whole framework is designed with two plain convolutional neural networks without downsampling, which can perform image decomposition and fusion efficiently.'
