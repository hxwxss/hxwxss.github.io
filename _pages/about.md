I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Automation from the [College of Engineering](https://cet.hzau.edu.cn/), [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in **Open World Vision** and **Multi-modal Learning**. I am actively seeking **research collaborations and opportunities** to investigate these areas further.

If you are interested in my research or would like to cooperate with me, please don't hesitate to contact me via email or WeChat (Yuxuan_CHENG02).  

**Starting this September, I will pursue a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen and the Shenzhen Loop Area Institute, under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoguang Han.**
