I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Automation from the [College of Engineering](https://cet.hzau.edu.cn/), [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/)

My research interests lie in **Open World Vision** and **Multi-modal learning**, with a current focus on exploring **spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs**. During my gap year, I am actively seeking **research collaborations and opportunities** to further investigate these areas.
