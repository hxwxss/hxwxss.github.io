I am a senior student majoring in automation at the [College of Engineering](https://cet.hzau.edu.cn/), [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on Computer Vision, specifically open-world vision and multi-modal learning. 

~~I will pursue the M.SC. in Communications Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in the fall of 2025.~~ I will join the Shenzhen Loop Area Institute and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen as a Phd student in the fall of 2025. I am seeking research opportunities related to Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
